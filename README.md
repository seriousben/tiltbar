## Features

- 🟢 **Dynamic Tilt logo** - Green when all good, gray when building, red on errors
- 📊 **Real-time updates** - No polling, streams directly from Tilt
- 🎯 **Clean display** - Just the logo when everything is green
- 🔄 **Auto-reconnect** - Handles Tilt restarts automatically
- 🚫 **Menu bar only** - No dock icon

## Installation

### Homebrew (Recommended)

```bash
brew install seriousben/tiltbar/tiltbar
```

**Launch the app:**

To make it visible in Spotlight/Alfred/Launchpad, copy it to Applications:
```bash
cp -r /opt/homebrew/opt/tiltbar/TiltBar.app ~/Applications/
```

Or launch it directly:
```bash
open /opt/homebrew/opt/tiltbar/TiltBar.app
```

> **Note:** The copy-to-Applications step is temporary while we prepare a Homebrew cask.

### From Source

**Requirements:**
- macOS 13.0+
- Xcode Command Line Tools: `xcode-select --install`

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/seriousben/tilt-status-bar.git
cd tilt-status-bar

# Build and run

That's it! The Tilt logo will appear in your menu bar.

## Requirements
