## Installation

### Homebrew (Recommended)

```bash

```

**Launch the app:**

To make it visible in Spotlight/Alfred/Launchpad, copy it to Applications:
```bash
cp -r /opt/homebrew/opt/tiltbar/TiltBar.app ~/Applications/
```

Or launch it directly:
```bash
open /opt/homebrew/opt/tiltbar/TiltBar.app
```

> **Note:** The copy-to-Applications step is temporary while we prepare a Homebrew cask.

### From Source

**Requirements:**
- macOS 13.0+
- Xcode Command Line Tools: `xcode-select --install`

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/seriousben/tilt-status-bar.git

That's it! The Tilt logo will appear in your menu bar.
